== Description ==

This add-on for  [Easy Property Listings](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=description&utm_campaign=wordpressorg_import) and WP All Import allows you to import listings into your WordPress website with ease with all the Easy Property Listings custom fields pre-configured.

Our goal with this add-on is not to just be able to import listings into Easy Property Listings but to improve import speed especially with images.

Supported formats are CSV and XML files with full support for the Australian REAXML format and Jupix UK format. We have implemented an image and ID skipping to minimise image imports so they are only updated when changed. We are seeing a 78% speed improvement using this plugin.

Faster and easier than ever to import data into Easy Property Listings custom post types with WP All Import.
